I am a third year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I am currently doing an internship as a UAV Performance Engineer at [Verity Studios](http://veritystudios.com/) in Zürich.

## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

I was born in Montréal and moved to Toronto in 2006. I obtained my Baccalauréat (the French high school diploma) form the [Lycée Français de Toronto](http://lft.ca/) in 2014. At the same time I was an active memeber of my local Air Cadet Squadron ([166 Bulldog RCACS](http://aircadetleague.com/squadron/166bulldog/)) and obtained my glider and private pilot licenses.

I am now working my way towards obtaining my BASc in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Robotics and Mechatronics at the University of Toronto. During the 2017-2018 academic year I will be working at [Verity Studios](http://veritystudios.com/) in Zürich as part of my [Professional Experience Year (PEY)](http://engineeringcareers.utoronto.ca/internship-programs/pey/) and thus should graduate in 2019.

## Research Interest

I am interested in the areas of control theory, robotics and machine learning. My preferred areas of research are mathematical in nature.

## Other Interests

My two great fascinations have always been space and robotics. However, outside of work I am an avid road biker and love travelling. I also very much enjoy learning languages. So far I can get around in French, English, German, Italian and most recently Czech. Farsi is next on my list.
